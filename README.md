# Fault-Analysis-of-N-Bus-System
Different Line Fault Analysis tested on a 4 bus system using MatLAB

This project utilizes MatLAB programming in order to calculate and predict the different kinds of faults that could occur in an N-bus sized system. Results outputted are the post fault voltages of the system at each bus as well as the fault current. The code was tested on a small 4-bus system (Figure attached) with reasonable data as results. 
Everything was calculated in per unit values. Although the results were reasonable, there are certain limitations and restrictions that need to be met for the code to produce reasonably correct results. In order to meet the specifications, there is also additional development that can be implemented to make the code further robust.
